  # Optional: If you find specific SDK components are missing even with this image,
  # you might still need to install them using sdkmanager.
  # For example, if your project requires compileSdk 34 and it's not present:
  # - yes | sdkmanager "platforms;android-34"
  # - yes | sdkmanager "build-tools;34.0.0"
  # You might not need these for common builds, as the image should come pre-loaded.
  # Comment them out initially and uncomment only if you get errors about missing SDK components.
